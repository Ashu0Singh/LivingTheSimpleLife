                    taking a bit of a approach though, in how 
                    you can find simplicity in the life you 
                    already living.

                        Food is a very important part of everyone's life. 
                        If you want to be healthy, you have to eat healthy. 
                        One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your 
                        cooking nice and simple.

                        Work is often a major source of stress. People get 
                        frustrated, it ruins their relationship with others 
                        and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life 
                        as simple as possible, it will help balance everything 
                        out.

                        A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. 
                        People either don't decorate, or they go overboard and 
                        it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. 
                        Staying simple will help draw the eye where you 
                        want it to and make things pop like never before.
